# B-Tree
A simple C++ B-Tree implementation using classes.

This git is intended to go with a tutorial video created for class, however, should entirely funtion on it's own.

This repo isn't actively maintained, however, should an issue arrise please create a new issue and I'll get to it as soon as I can.
